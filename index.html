    <h1>Welcome to My GitHub Page</h1>
    <p>Greetings! I'm a 3rd-year design student at Somaiya School of Design, embarking on an exciting creative journey. My passion for design drives my creativity, but when I'm not immersed in the world of design, you'll often find me on the cricket pitch, relishing the game's energy and teamwork. Additionally, I'm an enthusiastic gamer, diving into online adventures like Valorant. Beyond sports and gaming, I'm an unabashed food lover, constantly exploring diverse culinary experiences. My diverse interests, from design to cricket, gaming, and savoring delectable dishes, make me a well-rounded student with a zest for life's multifaceted pleasures.</p>
